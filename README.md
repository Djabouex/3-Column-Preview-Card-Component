This is my solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-) on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Djabouex).  
I designed and developed this project entirely by myself as a personal challenge to improve my front-end skills.

## 🛠 My Process

I started by analyzing the layout and breaking it down into components. I then structured the HTML semantically and used CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout. Finally, I added custom properties and hover effects to meet the design.
